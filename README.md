This is my latest [learning list](https://ticofab.io/tech/2020-04-11-planned-learning/).

I am interested in distributed systems and the challenges related to performance, resilience and scalability - so much that I founded the 'Reactive Amsterdam' meetup, where we discuss ideas and technologies related to these topics. I particularly like event-based, streaming data systems.
